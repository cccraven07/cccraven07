## Hi there, I'm Colin! 👋
I am a senior at the University of Notre Dame majoring in Physics with minors in Data Science and Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) graduating in May 2026. My work focuses on using quantitative tools to study complex systems across both physical and social sciences. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a research assistant studying how to incorporate satellite data into wartime reporting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how apply Python and data science methods to study real-world social science problems
- 🎯 This semester, I hope to build an organized, professional data science portfolio that showcases some of my projects. 
- ⚡ In my free time, I enjoy playing pickup basketball and exploring classic literature.
